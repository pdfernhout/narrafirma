==== NarraFirma to-do list:

H - high priority
M - medium priority
L - low priority
W - wish list

============ new things noticed/mentioned recently

- none right now 

=============== OLDER TODOS LIST ===================

------------- Infrastructure -------------

BUILD
? Remove Lodash dependency (maybe?)

VERSIONING
M Create script or procedure to deal with SVN for WordPress' plugin archive
M Upgrade to later node.js version
M Upgrade to later d3 library version

LOGGING
W Think through logging in the server, perhaps using a library
    Ensure useful server logs are kept
    Fix issue with PNIWorkbookServer.conf that it uses logs directory that is not server-data/logs
W Think through logging in the client, perhaps using a library
    Client application could report errors to server or another service
    Client application could report usage metrics to server or another service
W Support for socket.io to track recently added survey results and whether survey is enabled
W Support for socket.io to replace the need for polling for changes

TRANSLATION (INTERNATIONALIZATION)
W Translate report answers as needed for those types like selections
W Final review of all strings in code looking for TODO translate items or similar

TESTING
W Unit tests
W Continuous integration server that runs tests
W Cypress testing

SECURITY
W Hash password when sending from client to server (not strictly needed if use ssh, and without ssh everything is potentially insecure from MITM attacks)

------------- Data storage -------------

POINTREL
W Check time server on startup in server to see if accurate enough when timestamping versions; maybe same for client
W Ensure timestamp for latest triple store messages is being set on server and not client
W Simplify Pointrel system further, like to not have message trace adding so PHP WordPress plugin code can be simpler and quicker
W Simplify Pointrel system further, like to only store triples instead of general arbitrary message objects
W Show deleted-but-not-really items as greyed-out and "archived"; allow user to bring them back, instead of being surprised when reusing a name
W Improve slow reading of large projects in WP version

QUESTIONS
W Improve how options are specified for questions in question designer rather than use text box
W Make sure that short name IDs entered by user when defining questions are unique among themselves
W Think about issue of including project name in stories and triple a field in relation to backup/restore
W Think about what happens to data if questions change somehow in future versions of the software

GRID
M Implement duplication of items in grid

EXPORT/IMPORT
W Add way to clear out or reset old survey results? Or maybe partition them by survey?
W Give user list of data fields in questionnaire not found in data file
W Remove restriction that text fields to be added to the story text must be to the right of the main story text column (easy to forget)

VALIDATION
W Think about validation and how or when or if it should be done
W Validation of page data as progress through a step
W Validation in general when progress through tabs and error reporting
W Validation of text fields for empty
W Validation of text fields for length
DONE Validation for checkBoxes limited by maximum number of choices as validation error

DATA ENTRY
W Autosave for current textarea or input text based on timer even if you don't leave it

------------- Survey system -------------

SURVEY GENERAL
M If logged in, survey should not use "anonymous" user to connect (or should ask)
L All responses for selections (other than sliders) should have unique IDs for each response, and the stored response should have the ID as well as the chosen text at the time.
W Add unique ID so long survey results can be saved as progressed through and finished later if participant has unique ID
W Better mobile support for taking survey on cell phones
W Support uploading of images
W Compliance with accessibility standards
W Only store reference to questionnaire file resource, not the resource itself
W Support translations or other categories for multiple question texts or choice texts for a survey
W Some easy way for two or more survey sliders to be close together under the same label 

SURVEY QUESTIONS
W Ideally way to do conditional question or answer (piping), especially to pick participant group
W Need "other" field for radiobuttons and checkboxes (maybe dropdown, probably not)
W Survey - add checkbox for "is question answer required"
W Survey - start page required (what to do if nothing entered)
W Survey - improve styling on radio buttons for question or alternative approach 
W Survey - back button in browser -- deal with so don't lose data

------------- PNI phases -------------

PLANNING

COLLECTION
W Add support for providing story browser filter options based on analyzing data from surveys to collect all actual choices as well as current questionnaire(s)
W Remember previous filtering options for any question in story browser
W Story list using dgrid with accordion for story
W Add templates for annotation questions (re-add "Copy a question from a template" button, removed in commit 2dde70086198417d2d005e3a6707045c18823d22 2015-09-20 19:09:57)
W Consider supporting mass annotation - export stories with uuids, create new annotation question, import story uuids with new data in CSV file
W Consider adding support for floating point scale values in CSV import
DONE Consider adding support for semicolon instead of comma (and comma instead of dot for decimals) for CSV import/export

CATALYSIS
W Need a flip axis for slider for catalysis when graphing? 
W Support common maximum for multiple histograms 
W Show percentages for question answers in title hover over questions in catalysis report configuration --> not important
W Support storyThemer -- a widget where people look at each story, give it 1-3 themes, then merge the themes into smaller numbers of themes --> yes but time consuming
W Support an excerpt list somehow --> copy and paste from story list is good enough
W Need to be able to select text in existing story to AddToExcerpts
W Support storiesList -- for choosing a resonant story -> not important, can copy and paste texts
W Consider drawing contingency graphs with side plots showing shapes of distributions (bar graphs) for each question -> not important
W Make interpretations have link back to (single) observation, but retain search function for legacy data

SENSEMAKING

INTERVENTION
W One project outcome item created per participant group

RETURN

------------- Project management -------------

GENERAL
W Support Undo (including multi-user aspects with log)
W User should be able to duplicate a project -> can do with export/import
W Consider in "Print project report" checkboxes for different parts of the report

CONFIGURATION
W Add project configuration page with options on what fields/sections/pages to show for project

------------- User interface -------------

USABILITY
W Improve dashboards, perhaps with checkmarks and thinking through completion feedback to be better
W Support checkBoxesWithPull -- a set of check boxes where the display texts are drawn from a list entered previously (like for participant list)

MULTI USER
W Support mult-user chat
W Notify user of multi-user edit conflicts

ALERTS / MESSAGES
W Look at all alerts in code and make into nicer GUI feedback
M Report when a project can't be read by the current user even if the survey can be read (fix limitation of lumping permissions)
M Improve reporting on startup for loading project data with some kind of progress indicator or remaining count
M When import story form, hundreds of triples can be generated which take minutes to send to the server (with no progress feedback, even though done in background) -- may be related to console logging

* Fixed: A bug on the "Annotate stories" page where adding the first answer to a choice question also added an empty-string answer
* Fixed: A bug where clicking on the number of stories in a collection on the main/dashboard page did not bring up that collection on the "Review graphs" page
* Fixed: A bug where certain carriage-return characters within stories would cause the CSV export to misalign spreadsheet cells 
* Fixed: A bug where, in CSV story import, there was no backup default for a missing multi-choice single-column delimiter (it now defaults to a comma)

Added: Validation check to make sure that questions of types that require answer lists (select, radiobuttons, checkboxes) have answer lists. 
Added: For validation support, if you are editing a list item and you click a page-change button, a message will appear asking you to close the currently open item first. (NF needs you to do this so it can run its validation checks.)
