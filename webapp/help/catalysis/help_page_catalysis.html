<p>
The catalysis phase of a PNI project is an optional step in which mixed-methods analysis is 
used to discover patterns in collected stories and interpretations.
This phase is called catalysis (as opposed to analysis) because catalysis speeds up chemical 
reactions and catabolic processes break down molecules (while anabolic processes build them up). 
Thus catalysis serves to enhance sensemaking by asking questions, not avoid it by providing answers.
</p>
<p>
The catalytic material produced (for example, annotated images describing patterns across stories) 
is used as food for thought in the sensemaking process, but never as conclusive evidence or proof. 
To ensure that the material is catalytic rather than analytic, precautions are taken to <em>separate statements</em> 
(into observations, interpretations, and ideas) and <em>provide provoking perspectives</em> 
that generate questions rather than supply answers.
