On this page you can print story cards to be used in sensemaking sessions.

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">

Choose a story collection, then click the Print Story Cards button. The cards will appear in a separate window, and you can print them from your browser.

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
		Do I always have to print all of the stories in the story collection?
		</div>
		<div class="question-answer">
		<p>
			No. You can create a filter to print only some of the stories in a collection. 
			Find the place on this page that says <b>If you want to filter the stories printed, enter your filter here.</b> 
				In that box, enter the <i>exact</i> short name of a question (one that is in your story form), 
				followed by <b>two equals signs</b> (==), 
				followed by either a list of <i>exact</i> answers (separated by two equals signs), or
				the low and high values of a numerical range (separated by two equals signs). 
				</p>
				<p>Some examples:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Feel about == happy</b> will print only stories for which the question "Feel about" was answered "happy."</li>
					<li><b>Location == Northern == Eastern</b> will print stories for which the "Location" question was answered with either "Northern" or "Eastern."</li>
					<li><b>Story ended == 0 == 20</b> will print stories for which the scale question "Story ended" was answered with a number in the range from zero to twenty, inclusive.</li>
					<li><b>Story length == [0 == 200)</b> will print stories with text lengths of 0 to 199 characters.</li>
					<li><b>Story text == Company == company</b> will print stories in which the word "Company" appears (with either capitalization).</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Filtering stories for story cards works exactly like filtering stories for a catalysis report. 
			You can read more about filters on the help page on <a href="../catalysis/help_page_configureCatalysisReport.html">configuring catalysis reports</a>.

<div class="question">
	How do I use the <b>display lumping</b> feature?
	</div>
	<div class="question-answer">
	<p>
		Display lumping is described on the help page for <a href="../catalysis/help_page_configureCatalysisReport.html">configuring your catalysis report</a>.
		When you are printing story cards, you cannot use display lumping for any of the <i>generated</i> questions (Eliciting question, Number of stories told, Story length, Collection date). 
		However, it works for all story and participant questions.
	</p>
	</div>

<div class="question">
Should I truncate stories?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
	Usually, the stories you collect will be relatively short, a paragraph or two. But once in a while, especially if you are collecting your stories online,
	people will do strange things that create really long stories (like paste in whole files). 
	This can wreak havoc with your ability to print nice clean story cards. So you can <b>set an upper limit
	on story length</b>, with a note like "ask to see the full story" or something, so people know there is more to read. 
	Try a few different lengths to see what works.
</p>
<p>
	Note that NarraFirma gives you many options for this truncation, including printing only the first 100 characters of stories.
	We can't actually think of any reason you'd want to do that! But who knows, you might need it for some special reason. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What's this about characters?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Sliders (ranges) are represented in story cards as rows of characters (letters). 
By default a slider looks like this:
</p>
<p>-----|--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
If you like, you can change your sliders to use other characters and create displays like these:
</p>
<p>_____<>________________________________</p>
<p>.....⥣.............................................</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|||~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>===========================[]===========================</p>
<p>
A few tips on changing slider characters:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Some characters are wider than others. If your before-the-button character 
		is wider than your after-the-button character, your slider values may appear
		different than they really are.
	</li>
	<li>White space is collapsed in HTML. This means you can use an empty space
		for your after-the-button character, but you can't use it before the button.
	</li>
	<li>You can use emojis and other special characters, 
		but whether your browser and printer will print
		them correctly is anybody's guess. See what works for you.
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="question">
How do I use the "Custom CSS" feature?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Click "Print Story Cards," 
then use your browser to <strong>inspect</strong> any element of your story cards you want to change. 
(The usual way to do this is to right-click on a word or area and choose "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the popup menu that appears.
If you don't see a popup menu or an "Inspect" menu item, look up how to inspect a web page element in the browser you are using.
Sometimes you need to turn on "developer" mode to inspect page elements.)
</p>
<p>When you have successfully inspected the page element you want to change, you should see its CSS class. 
	Most of the classes start with "narrafirma-story-card".
</p>
<p>Next go to the "custom CSS" field on the the "Print story cards" page and
write a class selector (label) and declaration (set of formatting lines)
for that class. You can use your browser's style editor to experiment with CSS until you get the styling you want. 
</p>
<p>
For example, if you wanted all choice-question selections (drop-down list, checkboxes, radio buttons) to appear in blue, you would write a CSS statement
like this:
</p>
<code>.narrafirma-story-card-select-selected, .narrafirma-story-card-checkboxes-selected, .narrafirma-story-card-radiobuttons-selected { color: blue; }</code>
<p>
Then print your story cards again to see your change. 
(You can't just reload the story cards page; you have to click the "Print Story Cards" button again.)
