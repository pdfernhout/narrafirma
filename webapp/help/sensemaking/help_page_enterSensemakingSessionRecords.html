<div class="question">
What is a resonant story? What is a resonant pattern?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>Here are some excerpts from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(pages 349-351) that explain the three types of resonant stories. (Note that I don't actually call these things "resonant" in the book. I needed a term to refer briefly to all three types of story, so I called them "resonant" here.)
</p>
<div class="book-quote">
<div class="book-quote-heading">Pivot stories</div> 
<p>
As people follow threads of connection through dimensions of meaning in the stories they are considering, once in a while they will find themselves saying, &ldquo;Look, there&rsquo;s <i>that</i> story again.&rdquo; Those are what I call the pivot stories of the collection. Pivot stories <i>just keep coming up</i>.
Pivot stories are not usually the most memorable or revelatory stories in the collection, but they are situated at <i>articulations</i> of the story collection: joints, junctures, hinges, points of intersection. Because of this, in pivot stories <i>all of the things that matter in the project happen together</i>. Maybe trust meets rebellion, or the official story meets the ground truth, or the reason nobody will talk about something meets the reason nobody will fix something. It&rsquo;s all in there. These stories are like miniaturized copies of the entire project in one recounting of events. Read them and you can see what the project is about. 
</p>

<p>To observe the emergence of pivot stories, look at <i>wear patterns</i>. People who design things to be used repeatedly, like shoes and tires, and people who diagnose the health of things used repeatedly, like feet and hands, use wear patterns to understand how things are used. You can observe wear patterns as you observe sensemaking, by looking at the physical objects people use in your session. This is yet another reason why working with physical objects in sensemaking is easier than working with computers. On a computer, you <i>can</i> get at wear patterns, but you have to know things about computers that most people don&rsquo;t. Anybody can look at a card to see how much it has been handled. So, as people work with story cards and other information, look to see if some cards or sheets or names are more often handled (and copied and passed from hand to hand) than others. If some story cards are being literally worn out, those are the pivot stories.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">Voice stories</div> 
<p>
These are stories that sing out, that beg to be heard, that have wings and are poised to fly. They are memorable because they break through barriers of assumption, fear, ignorance, reluctance, or stereotype. They bring perspectives or experiences that are not widely known into wider awareness. Voice stories usually involve some risk to their tellers, but they also typically include relief and gratitude for &ldquo;the chance to finally speak out.&rdquo; Voice stories, as the name implies, are especially useful in communications about the project to those less involved with it. They speak for the people and project and stories involved in the session.
</p>

<p>To observe the emergence of voice stories, look for <i>retellings</i>. If a story wants to travel, it will find ways to be told and retold. In some sessions I&rsquo;ve seen one story bounce its way all around a room without any one participant becoming fully aware of how many times the story was retold. You can&rsquo;t see retelling in wear patterns, because telling a story doesn&rsquo;t necessarily put any fingerprints on its card; but you can <i>hear</i> voice stories being retold if you listen. Another way to observe voice stories is to listen for the creation of shorthand references. If you hear someone say, &ldquo;Did you hear the umbrella story yet?&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve found a voice story.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">Discovery stories</div> 
<p>
These stories solve mysteries. They are not particularly memorable or central, but they surprise somebody with new knowledge. You could also call them &ldquo;aha&rdquo; stories. When people encounter a discovery story, they say, &ldquo;Oh, is <i>that</i> how it is?&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know <i>that</i>.&rdquo;
In sensemaking, discovery stories have the potential to create new bridges of understanding between experiences, either between groups of people at the session or between the people at the session and the people who told the stories. The best discovery stories grow stories around themselves during sensemaking, stories where things change from one state of understanding (before the story) to another (after). These larger stories enter into and change the sensemaking process.
</p>

<p>To observe the emergence of discovery stories, look for <i>memoranda</i>. What I mean is, look for instances of people making a note of something they don&rsquo;t want to forget. Discovery stories, because they create new understandings, cause people to say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a note of that.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep that in mind.&rdquo; When you see people marking up stories with &ldquo;remember this&rdquo; markings, or making extra copies of stories, or putting stories in a special place where they can get at them again easily, you&rsquo;re seeing discovery stories emerge. 
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">Pivot patterns, voice patterns, discovery patterns</div> 
<p>
For each of these types of emergent story there is a corresponding type of emergent <i>pattern</i> in data about stories. Such patterns usually appear in answers to questions about stories, but patterns can appear in other information about stories too, like how long they are or what words they use. Emergent patterns are stories, too, only they are stories about what people discovered in the session.
</p>
<ul> 
<li> Pivot patterns work in the same way as pivot stories, only instead of saying &ldquo;there&rsquo;s that story again&rdquo; people say &ldquo;there&rsquo;s that pattern again.&rdquo; For example, you might hear people talking over and over about how the older the story, the less conflict is in it. When people come up with a motto based on repeated contact with a trend, a motto like &ldquo;the more we look back the better things get,&rdquo; they&rsquo;ve found a pivot pattern. </li>
<li> Voice patterns assemble the risks and releases embodied within voice stories into larger choruses. Voice patterns can be seen in retellings, just like voice stories. You&rsquo;ll hear people saying things like, &ldquo;Did you hear about the umbrellas-and-cats issue?&rdquo;</li>
<li> Discovery patterns are the closest a sensemaking session can get to the findings of an analytical study. These are patterns in the data that people notice and want to remember. Again, notice memoranda of patterns people want to get back to.</li>
</ul> 
<p>If a sensemaking session has gone well, by the end of it, some stories and patterns of each of these types should have emerged and resonated with the participants.

<div class="question">
What do you mean by "outcomes?"
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
<p>Here are some excerpts from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(pages 373-374) that explain what I mean.

<div class="book-quote">
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to end a session with list making, but for some projects and some participants it is extremely helpful. How much you need lists depends on how much information you need to transfer from the session to events and people outside of it. Lists <i>package</i> the change that took place in the session into a consolidated, compact form that can more easily pass out of the session and into consumption elsewhere. In some projects that&rsquo;s not necessary, because the people in the session <i>are</i> the decision makers. What took place in the room can stay in the room. 
</p>
<p>Here are some list items [outcomes] I&rsquo;ve used and seen used by others.

<table class="outcomes_table">

<div class="question">
What is a construction?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(page 380) that explains what I mean.
</p>
<div class="book-quote">
<p>
The things people made in your sensemaking session, things like timelines, landscapes, story elements, and composite stories, are all report-worthy items. You can photograph the constructions; you can reproduce them in a cleaner-looking medium, such as a slide presentation; you can describe them; you can even save the physical objects people have assembled. I still have the rolled-up results from several sensemaking sessions in my office, and sometimes when I want to think about sensemaking I get them out and look at them. I&rsquo;ve helped with sessions where helpers copied walls full of sticky notes onto PowerPoint slides to show them to people who didn&rsquo;t attend the session. It took hours and hours to get all those labels typed in, but it was worth it, because ten times more people could use the constructions afterward. You can also record people describing their constructions in audio or video.
