<h1 class="page-title">Tell project stories</h1>

<div class="text">
<p>Thinking about what might happen in your project
is a great way to find out what you want to achieve and what you are afraid might happen. 
Your hopes and fears can guide you in making project plans.
On the next page (<a href="help_page_createProjectStoryElements.html">Create project story elements</a>) 
you can use your project stories to make sense of your plans. But you need at least
a few stories to create story elements!
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>Tell some stories about how your project might play out. 
They don't have to be long or complicated. Just choose a scenario and an outcome, then think about what might happen.
</p>
<p>The more stories you can tell, the better you can prepare. 
Try to tell at least three stories &mdash; five is better. Make sure you have at least one of each type of outcome
(colossal success, miserable failure, and acceptable outcome). 
If you are working in a team, make sure <i>everybody</i> on the team tells at least one
one story for each outcome (colossal success, miserable failure, and acceptable outcome).

What do the scenario types mean?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
	<p>
<b>Ask me anything:</b> If you could ask any person any question and would be guaranteed to get an honest 
answer (magically), whom would you ask, and about what? What would happen if you did?
</p>
<p>
<b>Magic ears:</b> If you could overhear anyone talking to anyone at any time 
and in any place, whom would you want to listen to, where, and when? What might happen?
</p>
<p>
<b>Fly on the wall:</b> If you could observe any situation or event, what situation would you want to witness? 
Imagine what would happen if you did.
</p>
<p>
<b>Project aspects:</b> Consider your draft answers to the <a href=help_page_planningQuestionsDraft.html>PNI planning questions</a>.

</p>
<p>
