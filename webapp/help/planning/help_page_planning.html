<p>
During the planning phase of a PNI project, you choose and/or design 
project elements such as questions, group sessions, and exercises. 
For example, you might use a small pilot project to test questions and methods before your 
larger project takes place. Planning serves to promote the success of your overall project, 
not to constrict or censor what is collected and said. </p>

<div class="question">
Is the planning phase required?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
The planning phase is placed outside the essential PNI triangle, so it's an optional activity. But in NarraFirma, the part of the planning phase where you <a href="help_page_participantGroups.html">describe your participant groups</a> and <a href="help_page_describeYourResources.html">describe your resources</a> drive the recommendations shown on these pages:
<ul>
<li><a href="../collection/help_page_chooseCollectionVenues.html">story collection venues</a></li>
<li><a href="../collection/help_page_writeStoryElicitingQuestions.html">story eliciting questions</a></li>
<li><a href="../collection/help_page_writeQuestionsAboutStories.html">questions about stories</a></li>
<li><a href="../collection/help_page_writeQuestionsAboutParticipants.html">questions about participants</a></li>
<li><a href="../collection/help_page_planStoryCollectionSessions.html">story collection sessions</a></li>
<li><a href="../sensemaking/help_page_planSensemakingSessions.html">sensemaking sessions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
So if you want to get recommendations on any of these things later on, you should at least describe your participant groups and your resources in the planning phase.

<div class="question">
Where can I enter a pilot story collection as part of planning?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Set it up in the <a href="../collection/help_page_collection.html">Collection</a>  phase. 
Create a story form, and use it to enter your data (or to ask other people to answer questions). 
You can even create a pilot <a href="../catalysis/help_page_catalysis.html">catalysis report</a>, then use it in your planning. NarraFirma doesn't have a special "reflect on your pilot story collection" page, but you can incorporate what you learned when you <a href="help_page_revisePNIPlanningQuestions.html">finalize your answers</a> to the PNI planning questions.
