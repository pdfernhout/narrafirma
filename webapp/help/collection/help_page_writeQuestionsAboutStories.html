<div class="page-title">Write questions about stories</div>
<div class="text">
<p>
Here is where you can write questions to ask people about their stories. You'll draw from these questions when you create your story forms.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Add some questions to your list. For each question, write what you want to ask people. Choose what type of answers you will collect (see below for an explanation of the types). 
Also give each question a short name. <strong>Make sure the short name is actually short</strong>, so there's room to write it in tables and on graphs.
</p>
<p>
You can copy questions from built-in templates (suggestions). Change the blank spaces (_____) in the question to suit your project and participants.
</p>
<p>
For help choosing, click the "Recommendations for story questions" button. You'll see a table that shows the various options, color-coded with evaluations of risk, connected to the answers you gave to questions about your <a href="../planning/help_page_participantGroups.html">participant groups</a> and <a href="../planning/help_page_describeYourResources.html">resources</a>.

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
Why ask questions about stories?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Asking questions helps people make sense of their own stories. These interpretations increase your project's breadth and depth of exploration, leading to deeper insights. When you ask not just "what happened" but "what does that <em>mean</em> to you," you've gone further and deeper in.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
How many questions should I ask about each story?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<ul>
<li>For a <strong>kiosk</strong> type project, in which people are just walking by and have no commitment to the project at all, you can ask <strong>three to five</strong> questions about each story.</li>
<li>For a <strong>volunteer</strong> type project, in which people feel socially obligated to participate, you can ask <strong>six to nine</strong> questions about each story.</li>
<li>For a <strong>commitment</strong> type project, in which people feel that participating is linked to their identities, you can ask <strong>ten to fifteen</strong> questions about each story.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="question">
How do I set the order of the questions?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You don't set the question order here. You only create the questions here. You set the order of questions when you design your story form. That's so you can reuse your questions in multiple story forms.
</p>

				All sliders start out with this checkbox checked. When a participant <i>moves</i> the slider (using the mouse or an arrow key), the box gets unchecked.

<div class="question">
	Could you explain write-in answers?
	</div>
	<div class="question-answer"> 
	<p>
		A free-text write-in answer option can be:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>an "other" option</strong> under a list of fixed answers (e.g., "happy / sad / _______")</li>
			<li><strong>a follow-up question</strong> asking for more detail (e.g., "Why do you think the story turned out the way it did?")</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		You can create a write-in answer option for every type of question (except "header" and "label," which are not really questions at all).
		To create a write-in answer option, <strong>enter a label</strong> you want to appear before the text box. 
		Some examples might be "other" (after a list of choices) or "Care to elaborate?" (after any type of question).
		If you leave the write-in field blank, no write-in option will be shown.
		</p><p>
		If you want to give people more room to write, start your label with two asterisks (**). NarraFirma will trim off the asterisks and display a multi-line, expandable text box.
	</p>
	You can access your write-in answers in three places:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> page, you can see the write-in answers for each story. 
			You can also <strong>change write-in answers</strong> on this page. Sometimes participants troll the survey by writing foul language 
			or reveal too much private information. When that happens, you can (carefully) clean things up here.</li>
		<li>On the <a href="../catalysis/help_page_explorePatterns.html">Explore patterns</a> page, you can read your write-in answers and create observations based on them.</li>
		<li>On the <a href="../sensemaking/help_page_printStoryCards.html">Print story cards</a> page, you can show (or hide) your write-in answers on your story cards.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I use HTML formatting for questions?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can use these HTML tags: address, article, b, big, blockquote, br, caption, cite, code, del, div, dd, d1, dt, em, 
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, hr, i, kbd, li, ol, p, pre, s, small, span, sup, sub, strong, strike, table, td, th, tr, u, ul.
</p>
<p>
You can also use a smaller subset of HTML tags (b, big, em, i, s, small, sup, sub, strong, strike, u) in your 
specified answers (choices) for checkboxes and radio buttons.
</p>
<p>
HTML tags affect how your question texts appear in your online survey and in the "Enter or import stories" screen. 
They are stripped out when you print your story form.
</p>
<p>
To protect your NarraFirma installation from hacking, you cannot use attributes (such as "id") on any of these tags.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I create my own templates?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Only if you are comfortable editing the source code files in your installation of NarraFirma. If you are, find the file called "templates.js" and add your template to it. (Backup the file first!) Follow the formatting in the templates you see, and make sure you put your template in the right part of the file. If NarraFirma won't start up after you make your changes, check your browser's console to find out where the error lies.
