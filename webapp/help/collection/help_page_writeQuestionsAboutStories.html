<h1 class="page-title">Write questions about stories</h1>
<div class="text">
<p>
On this page you can write questions that you will ask people about their stories. 
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
Add some questions to your list. For each question, write what you want to ask people. 
Choose what type of answers you will collect. 
See below for an explanation of the question types. 
</p>
<p>
Give each question a short name. <strong>Make sure the short name is actually short</strong>, so there's room to write it in tables and on graphs.
As a general rule, short names should be less than 20 characters long. If your question has a fixed list of answers, the answers should also be short.
</p>
<p>
You can copy questions from built-in templates (suggestions). Change the blank spaces (_____) in the question to suit your project and participants.
</p>
<p>
For help choosing, click the "Recommendations for story questions" button. You'll see a table that shows the various options, color-coded with evaluations of risk, connected to the answers you gave to questions about your <a href="../planning/help_page_participantGroups.html">participant groups</a> and <a href="../planning/help_page_describeYourResources.html">resources</a>. 
</p>

<div class="text">
<p>
	The questions you create here will be available to use 
	when you create a <a href="help_page_designStoryForms.html">story form</a>.
	Note that <b>you are not designing a story form</b> on this page. 
	This list of questions is more like a <b>question library</b> from which you can choose
	when you create a story form.

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
Why ask questions about stories?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Asking questions helps people make sense of their own stories. These interpretations increase your project's breadth and depth of exploration, leading to deeper insights. When you ask not just "what happened" but "what does that <em>mean</em> to you," you've gone further and deeper in.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
How many questions should I ask about each story?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>For a <strong>kiosk</strong> type project, in which people are just walking by and have no commitment to the project at all, you can ask <strong>three to five</strong> questions about each story.</li>
</p><p>
	For a <strong>volunteer</strong> type project, in which people feel socially obligated to participate, you can ask <strong>six to nine</strong> questions about each story.</li>
</p><p>
	For a <strong>commitment</strong> type project, in which people feel that participating is linked to their identities, you can ask <strong>ten to fifteen</strong> questions about each story.</li>
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
How do I set the order of the questions?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You don't set the question order here. 
You only create the questions here. 
You set the order of questions when you design your story form. 
</p>
</div>

Can you explain the types of answers?

<h3 class="question">
	Could you explain write-in answers?
	</h3>
	<div class="question-answer"> 
	<p>
		A free-text write-in answer option can be:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>an "other" option</strong> under a list of fixed answers (e.g., "happy / sad / _______")</li>
			<li><strong>a follow-up question</strong> asking for more detail (e.g., "Why do you think the story turned out the way it did?")</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		You can create a write-in answer option for every type of question (except "header" and "label," which are not really questions at all).
		To create a write-in answer option, <strong>enter a label</strong> you want to appear before the text box. 
		Some examples might be "other" (after a list of choices) or "Care to elaborate?" (after any type of question).
		If you leave the write-in field blank, no write-in option will be shown.
		</p><p>
		If you want to give people more room to write, start your write-in-answer-option
		label with two asterisks (**). NarraFirma will trim off the asterisks and display a multi-line, expandable text box.
	</p>
	You can access your write-in answers in three places:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> page, you can see the write-in answers for each story. 
			You can also <strong>change write-in answers</strong> on this page. Sometimes participants troll the survey by writing foul language 
			or reveal too much private information. When that happens, you can (carefully) clean things up here.</li>
		<li>On the <a href="../catalysis/help_page_explorePatterns.html">Explore patterns</a> page, you can read your write-in answers and create observations based on them.</li>
		<li>On the <a href="../sensemaking/help_page_printStoryCards.html">Print story cards</a> page, you can show (or hide) your write-in answers on your story cards.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Can I use HTML formatting for questions?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can use these HTML tags: address, article, b, big, blockquote, br, caption, cite, code, del, div, dd, d1, dt, em, 
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, hr, i, kbd, li, ol, p, pre, s, small, span, sup, sub, strong, strike, table, td, th, tr, u, ul.
</p>
<p>
You can also use a smaller subset of HTML tags (b, big, em, i, s, small, sup, sub, strong, strike, u) in your 
specified answers (choices) for checkboxes and radio buttons.
</p>
<p>
HTML tags affect how your question texts appear in your online survey and in the "Enter or import stories" screen. 
They are stripped out when you print your story form.
</p>
<p>
To protect your NarraFirma installation from hacking, you cannot use attributes (such as "id") on any of these tags.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="question">
Can I create my own templates?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Only if you are comfortable editing the source code files in your installation of NarraFirma. If you are, find the file called "templates.js" and add your template to it. (Backup the file first!) Follow the formatting in the templates you see, and make sure you put your template in the right part of the file. If NarraFirma won't start up after you make your changes, check your browser's console to find out where the error lies.
