In the return phase of a PNI project, what has been gathered and produced in the first two essential phases (collection and sensemaking) is returned to the community and enters into collective discourse. Return may include formal reports and communications, and it may involve a wide or narrow distribution of collected stories. But it is also likely to include informal story exchanges about people’s experiences surrounding the project. These informal storytellings may be more influential than the formal outputs, for better or worse, and they merit attention on their own terms.
