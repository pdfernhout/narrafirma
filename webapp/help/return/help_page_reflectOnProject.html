<div class="text">
<p>
This page is your chance to have a thorough after-action review. Look back on everything that happened in your project. Years later,
when you go back and try to remember what happened during this project,
these words will be like gold to you.

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
Just answer the questions. If you are working in a group, it might be 
a good idea to have each person answer separately (and label their
responses). Or have a meeting, discuss each question, and write
down the gist of your discussion.
