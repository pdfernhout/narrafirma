<h1 class="page-title">Prepare outline of project presentation</h1>
<div class="text">
<p>
	You can use this page to build a simple <b>outline for a presentation</b>
	in which you explain your project to other people (your funders, your colleagues, your community). 
</p>
<p>Note that this page is more of a placeholder for future functionality than it is an actual attempt at functionality.
	The main reason to include it in NarraFirma is that if you do create a project presentation, 
	you will have saved at least its outline in your NarraFirma project for later reference.

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
Think about the points you want to make in your presentation. 
For each, answer the questions. You can copy story excerpts from elsewhere and paste them here. 
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">Connections to other pages</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
	This page is for your records only. Using it has no effect on any other page in the application.

<h2 class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="question">
Can I include graphs created during the project?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
No. As it stands now, this page is far too simple to support that.
If you want to include graphs in your presentation, you can <i>describe</i> them here.
But you will need to <i>add</i> them to your presentation outside of NarraFirma.
To do that, create a catalysis report, print it, and  
copy any images you want to use into your presentation.
